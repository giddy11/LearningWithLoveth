    1. WHat is Flexbox?
    Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model that allows you to design complex layouts more easily and efficiently. It provides a way to distribute space along a single row or column, making it easier to align and distribute items within a container.
    2. Why use Flexbox?
    Flexbox is particularly useful for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. It simplifies the process of aligning and distributing space among items in a container, making it easier to create flexible and dynamic layouts.
    KEY IDEA:
      1. It works along one main axis(horizontal or vertical)
